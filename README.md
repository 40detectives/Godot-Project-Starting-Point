# Godot Project Starting Point
Starting point project. Use it to your heart's content.

1. Fork this project and use it as starting point to develop your own godot projects. 

2. gitignore (Godot + Linux/Windows) & gitattributes (EOL handling + LFS) files are already configured with the _usual_ settings for a godot project development ander Windows or Linux. 

3. BAM! _(Productivity Skyrocketing)_
